Experience and History

Working on the UIKit team.

Lead engineer on the [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards) canvas team.

Cards are a way of attaching dynamic interactive content to tweets, based on a custom markup language, with renderers integrated in the iOS, Android, and Web Twitter clients. Cards can:

  * Present content like article summaries, photo galleries, and video players 
  * Show customized ads to promote [mobile apps](https://blog.twitter.com/2014/introducing-mobile-app-promotion), generate leads, and promote products 
  * Handle app "deep links", App Store integration, and install tracking 
  * Present custom experiences for events like World Cup scores and Oscars polls 
  * Allow third parties to integrate into Twitter 

I started by implementing the cards renderer for iOS, then also took responsibility for the markup language compiler in the backend, written in Scala.

Coordinated with the teams running the cards backend and publishing tools, and assisted internal and third-party teams using and creating cards. Helped set our feature roadmap and quarterly goals, planned new features, and wrote architecture documents for engineers and execs.

Developed a new iOS / Mac remote access product, [Air Login](http://www.avatron.com/applications/air-login/).

On the Mac, implemented a system-level coordination daemon, per-user screen capture agent, and controller UI, all communicating via XPC. On iOS, prototyped the client app.

Shipped several releases of [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/ios/keynote/), [Pages](http://www.apple.com/ios/keynote/), [Numbers](http://www.apple.com/ios/numbers/), and iWeb, on both Mac and iPad.

For iWork on iPad: Designed and implemented a Core Animation-based graphics and interaction framework. On a tight schedule, we built a revolutionary touch-based UI, pushing the limits of an untried OS and hardware, and shipped all three apps on time with the first iPad.

For iWork and iWeb on Mac: Was lead engineer for our graphics framework, built on OpenGL and Quartz. Designed and implemented new features, from high-level UI to low-level details, across the whole suite. While we were primarily responsible for graphics and interaction, I also had a hand in text layout and rendering, document storage, import/export, performance, and HTML widgets.

Led a team of three engineers. Wrote, triaged, analyzed, and fixed thousands of bug reports. Ran daily scrum meetings, estimated schedules, planned feature sets for releases, wrote prototypes and documentation, and filed for patents. Coordinated with design, engineering, QA, product management, and marketing.

Worked on a variety of Mac OS X and WebObjects projects, for consulting clients and for Omni directly.

  * Led development of a vertical-market store management app for Mac OS X, [Salon Transcripts](http://www.salontranscripts.com/). 
  * Added features to, and fixed bugs in, the web browser [OmniWeb](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/) (winner of two Apple Design Awards in 2001). 
  * For the online store of a major software company: cleaned up the architecture, upgraded code to modern standards, and fixed bugs. 
  * Wrote Mac OS X, Windows, and WebObjects applications that worked with relational databases (Oracle, FrontBase, DB2, and Sybase). 

Developed and shipped 3 original multimedia education titles for Mac and PC, using C++ and in-house cross-platform libraries. Also developed a prototype implementation of a "kid safe" web browser for the Mac, using custom code on top of Internet Explorer. Collaborated with teams of programmers, artists, sound designers, and educators.
